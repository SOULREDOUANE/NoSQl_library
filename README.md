# Library Management Project

## Steps to Build the Project:

1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Install Python, MongoDB, and Neo4j on your system.
   - Create a new directory for your project.

2. **Database Design**:
   - Define the schema for MongoDB and Neo4j databases based on the requirements.

3. **Develop Backend**:
   - Write Python code to interact with MongoDB and Neo4j databases.
   - Implement CRUD operations for managing books, authors, members, loans, and user accounts.

4. **Synchronization Logic**:
   - Implement synchronization logic to ensure data consistency between MongoDB and Neo4j databases.

5. **User Interface**:
   - Develop a user interface (web-based or command-line) for interacting with the library management system.

6. **Authentication Module** (Bonus):
   - Implement user authentication and management using Neo4j or MongoDB.

7. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Test the application thoroughly to ensure functionality and data integrity.
   - Debug any issues or errors encountered during testing.

8. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application to a server or cloud platform for production use.

## Database Format:

### MongoDB:

1. **Collections**:
   - `books`: Stores information about books.
     - Fields: `_id`, `title`, `author`, `isbn`, etc.
   - `members`: Stores information about library members.
     - Fields: `_id`, `name`, `email`, etc.
   - `loans`: Stores loan transactions between members and books.
     - Fields: `_id`, `book_id`, `member_id`, `date_borrowed`, `date_due`, `date_returned`, etc.

### Neo4j:

1. **Nodes**:
   - `Author`: Represents authors of books.
     - Properties: `name`, etc.
   - `Book`: Represents books in the library.
     - Properties: `title`, `isbn`, etc.

2. **Relationships**:
   - `WROTE`: Connects authors to the books they wrote.
